# The Chess Game Site is live at: https://mouner1.github.io/chess-game/

READ ME: 
The chess game project is developed using ReactJS, CSS/HTML/Typescript. This project is around 80% done. The rules and functionalities(killing,moving) for all pieces are working. I am using this project as a way for me to learn how ot program in typescript and react. I used the help of online tutorials to help me understand how some functions work to achieve my desired result.

FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS AND CURRENT WORK IN PROGRESS:

Work In Progress: Pawn Promotion once it reaches the end of the board.
Future Implementations: - Turns for multiplayer usage
                        - Checmate and more-strict king movement rules
                        - Implementation of UI elements like a timer and pieces that have been killed for each team.
