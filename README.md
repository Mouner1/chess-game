FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS AND CURRENT WORK IN PROGRESS:

Work In Progress: Pawn Promotion once it reaches the end of the board.
Future Implementations: - Turns for multiplayer usage
                        - Checmate and more-strict king movement rules
                        - Implementation of UI elements like a timer and pieces that have been killed for each team.
